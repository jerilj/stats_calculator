### Math Table

|ID| Task | Description | Formula | Example |
|--|------|-------------|---------|---------|
|1|Addition| Sum of two or or numbers| a + b = c| 1 + 2 = 2|
|2|Subtraction| Difference between two numbers| a - b = c| 2 - 1 = 1|
|3|Multiplication| Product of two numbers| a * b = c| 2 * 1 = 2|
|4|Division| Quotient of two numbers| a / b = c| 2 / 1 = 2|
|5|Square| Multiplying number by itself | a^2 | 2^2 = 4|
|6|Square Root| Square root of a number a is the  number b whose square is a | √a = b| √4 = 2 | 
|7|Mean| Average of list of numbers| Mean of numbers 1,2,3 is (a + b + c )/3 = c| (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 2|
|8|Median| Median is the middle of sorted list of numbers| Media of numbers 1,2,3 is 2 | |
|9|Mode| Number that appears most often| Media of numbers 1,2,2,3 is 2| |
|10|Variance| Average of the squared differences from the Mean|∑^n i=1 (xi− xˉ)^2 / n| [(1 - 2)2 + (2 - 2)2 + (3 - 2)2] ÷ 3 = 0.667|
|11|Standard Deviation| The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are|√(x−μ)^2/N | |
|12|Z-Score| A z-score measures exactly how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is| x−μ/σ | |
